## Task 1: Adding some CSS to code

### Step 1
While you are on the main page of your repo, press the `.` (period) key on your keyboard.  
This will open the repo in VSCode in your browser and allow you to edit the files in the repo.  
Create a HTML file with a heading example heading would be `BB`

Add this css for h1 to index.css
```css 
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
```

### Step 2
Create a HTML file with an unordered list element representing a navigation bar.  
Here is an example of what the HTML should look like:  
```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="index">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="about">About</a></li>
</ul>
```
The `href` indicates the url of the page that the link should go to.  
These are relative urls, so they will go to the page without changing the domain.

The list will be used for naviagation later on so think of some pages names.  
Add this css for ul to index.css
```css
ul {
  font-size: 15px;
  text-align: left;
  color: black;
}
```

## Task 2: Commiting your changes
Click the Source Control icon on the left hand side of the screen (looks like a branch)  
Enter a commit message in the box at the top of the screen (use a good commit message)  
Click Commit and Push to save the changes in a commit.  
Wait for the website to be updated (this may take a few minutes and you can check the progress in the Actions tab of your repo or the tick/orange dot next to the commit)

<br><hr>

## Task 3: Optional add a text which would include a description of the page
Create an HTML file with text.
Use CSS to style the p with a specific font, color, and size.
